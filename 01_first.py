# file is also iterable just like list, string, tuple etc.
# __next__  and __iter__ are the two methods that are used to iterate over the file.
# just smme we can write next() and iter() for file also.

# FOR FILES:
# readline for file handle the exception of EOF automatically.
# but next() does not handle the exception of EOF automatically.
