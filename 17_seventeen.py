# how python is getting executed  ->  Python's execution model combines elements of both compiled and interpreted languages. When a Python script runs, the source code is first compiled into an intermediate format called bytecode. This bytecode is then executed by the Python interpreter. This two-step process allows Python to balance the speed and efficiency of compiled languages with the flexibility and interactivity of interpreted languages, making it a versatile and widely-used programming language.

# Compile -> Byte Code -> VM machine -> interpriteed code -> output
